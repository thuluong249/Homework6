- To build this weather dashboard I needed to build from HTML, CSS and Javascript. And get it run bay getting the data from the website: [OpenWeather API] (https://openweathermap.org/api), save the information in Local Storage.
---
- At first I need to build the Inputs to search for the place that I wanted to get infomation from like New York City, Kent CT...
---
- And, after searching for the city, country... the data is saved all the history. When I need to view it, it will shows all the information about the temperature, humidity, the wind speed and the UVIndex. 
---
- And, the page will shows 5 day forecast with display date, temperature and the humidity for that city. 
---
- Last, if I click on the last city saved on the page, it will shows the current data have been found.
